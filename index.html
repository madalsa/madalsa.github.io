               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Census data is crucial to understand energy and environmental justice outcomes such as poor air quality which disproportionately impact people of color in the U.S. Wwith the advent of sophisticated personal datasets and analysis, Census Bureau is considering adding top-down noise (differential privacy) and post-processing 2020 census data to reduce the risk of identification of individual respondents. Using 2010 demonstration census and pollution data, I find that compared to the original census, differentially private (DP) census significantly changes ambient pollution exposure in areas with sparse populations. White Americans have lowest variability, followed by Latinos, Asian, and Black Americans. DP underestimates pollution disparities for SO2 and PM2.5 while overestimates the pollution disparities for PM10.</p>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Ensuring reliable and affordable access to modern energy services, especially for the poorer and deprived section of the population, is a basic requisite for sustainable development. Given that a majority of the energy-deprived population lives in rural regions of developing countries, an effective rural electrification is critical for bridging the rural-urban divide. Building on energy access intervention, implementing productive energy services can influence the next stages of development through livelihood activities, microenterprises, lifestyle energy services, value-added activities, survival irrigation, and so on. Social benefits of access to healthcare, education, and longer productive hours have an equally important impact on sustainable development. In India, for example, 240 million people lack electricity access. While grid extension in India is on the rise through various government programs, specific rural problems of low energy demand, poor rural economy, inaccessible terrain, and low purchasing power can render grid extension expensive and inefficient. Microgrid electricity systems, especially with hybrid renewable energy resources, can be a good alternative for addressing above-mentioned challenges. India enjoys high solar intensity, and the predominantly agrarian rural society has enough biomass resources, abundant cattle dung, forest foliage, and agricultural waste. A solar-biomass hybrid electricity system can solve the problem of intermittency of solar. Such a hybrid electricity system is being implemented in a remote Indian unelectrified village for electricity access, livelihoods, and economic empowerment. In this paper, we report the techno-economic feasibility and sustainability analysis of this hybrid system. The system consists of 30-kW solar photo voltaic (PV) and 20-kW biomass gasifier modules. Energy demand and resource availability are estimated with inputs from extensive stakeholder discussions and field surveys, and they account for daily and seasonal variations in both supply and end uses and availability and productive hours. The expected temporal electricity demand is estimated for households, community, irrigation, and commercial needs. The techno-economic feasibility is assessed using hybrid optimization model for electric renewable energy (HOMER). Furthermore, opportunities for the development of productive uses and their expansion through a sustainable business model are explored.</p>

          <li> <a> How clean does the U.S. electricity grid need to be to ensure electric vehicles reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to hybrid gasoline vehicles? [with Tugce Yuksel, Jeremy Michalek, In&#234s Azevedo] </a><b><i>In review</i></b>.</li>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Emissions from electric vehicles depend on when they are charged, and which power plants are meeting the electricity demand. We introduce a new metric, the grid emissions factors (CEFs), as the emissions intensity of electricity that needs to be achieved when charging to ensure electric vehicles achieve lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions parity with some of the most efficient gasoline hybrid vehicles across the US. We use a consequential framework, consider 2018 as our reference year, and account for effects of temperature and drive cycle on vehicle efficiency to account for regional climate and use conditions. We find that the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt battery electric vehicles reduce lifecycle emissions relative to Toyota Prius and Honda Accord gasoline hybrids in most of United States. However, in rural counties of the Midwest and the South power grid marginal emissions reductions of up to 208 gCO2/kWh are still needed for these electric vehicles to have lower lifecycle emissions than the gasoline hybrids. Except for the Northeast and Florida, the longer-range Tesla Model S battery electric luxury sedan has higher emissions than the hybrids across the U.S., and the emissions intensity of the grid would need to decrease by up to 342 gCO2/kWh in some locations for it to achieve carbon parity with hybrid gasoline vehicles. Finally, we conclude that coal retirements and stricter standards on fossil fuel generators are more effective in the medium term at reducing consequential electric vehicle emissions than expansion of renewable capacity. </p>

          <li> <a> Distributional impacts of fleet-wide change in light duty transportation: mortality risks of PM2.5 emissions from electric vehicle and tier 3 conventional vehicles. [With Chris Tessum, Julian Marshall, In&#234s Azevedo] </a><b><i>In review</i></b>.</li>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Light duty transportation continues to be a significant source of air pollutants that cause premature mortality and greenhouse gases that lead to climate change. To reduce the damages from air pollution and climate change, the U.S. light duty fleet will need to transition to more sustainable transportation strategies. Electric vehicles (EVs) are one of the possible strategies. Internal combustion vehicles which comply with latest emissions standards (currently, Tier 3 emission standard) are another possible alternative, although their emissions increase with age and mileage. While pollution from ICV occurs at ground level and its effects are largely confined to nearby areas, pollution from EVs occurs at the smokestacks of power plants used to charge the EVs which can spread to longer distances. We estimate and compare the health impacts (and disparities of) the current stock of light duty vehicles across the United States with a large-scale shift to EVs or Tier-3 ICV. We couple a fine-scale emissions inventory with a reduced complexity air quality model. We find that either strategy reduces premature mortality by 80-93% compared to today’s light duty vehicle damages. As the grid decarbonizes, EV would lead to even larger health benefits from reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (a benefit not present for ICV). The health and climate mitigation benefits of electrification are larger in the West and Northeast. The Midwest and the South have larger mortality reductions when choosing Tier 3 ICV due to present-day high electricity emission intensity; this aspect too may shift as those regions clean their electric grid emissions. We also focus on the 50 most populous metropolitan areas, and find that in almost all cases electrification leads to lower health damages. Pollution from ICV (current LDV and Tier 3) impact people of color more than White Americans across all states, levels of urbanization, and household income. Consequently, electrification reduces health disparities more than Tier 3 ICV in most states and MSAs, especially in urban parts of the Western United States. EV impacts are on average more equitable by race-ethnicity but damages from them are geographically concentrated in Ohio Valley, New York, and Pennsylvania; retiring or retrofitting with CCS 50 power plants with high SO2 emissions achieves health benefits parity for EVs and new Tier 3 ICVs in all regions. </p>

          <li> <a> Pathways to Zero Emissions in California’s Light-Duty Transportation Sector. [With Nora Henessey, Sarah Saltzer, In&#234s Azevedo] </a><b><i>In submission</i></b>.</li>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> In this work, we explore pathways to achieve zero emissions in California’s light duty transportation sector by 2045. We establish a business-as-usual trajectory and focus on fleet turnover dynamics under different policy scenarios. Specifically, we consider following policies and their combination: (i) a zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) sales mandate and (ii) accelerated retirement of internal combustion vehicles (ICV). Scenarios test calendar year for the onset of mandates and retirements as well as retirement age of vehicles. We discuss the implications of delaying the start of these policies on cumulative emissions of climate warming greenhouse gases and other air pollutants which harm public health. We consider the benefits and costs of accelerated retirement strategies by monetizing avoided climate and health damages and using second-hand vehicles prices as proxy for the costs. We find that even with aggressive ZEV mandates, the state will need accelerated retirements of ICV to achieve zero emissions by 2045. Targeted, cost effective accelerated scrappage policies can achieve the 2045 goal while significantly reducing cumulative air emissions. </p>

          <li> <a> Pathways to Zero Emissions in California’s Heavy-Duty Transportation Sector. [With Nora Henessey, Sarah Saltzer, In&#234s Azevedo] </a><b><i>In submission</i></b>.</li>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> California has ambitious climate targets including a goal of reaching economy-wide net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2045. To achieve this, all sectors of the economy will need to rapidly decrease their emissions in the coming decades. Nearly 8% of the state’s GHG emissions are caused by the heavy-duty transportation sector. In this work we assess decarbonization strategies for the heavy-duty vehicle fleet by focusing on two policy options: zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) sale mandates, and accelerated retirement programs. We construct a detailed, bottom-up fleet turnover model paired with an emissions model and air quality model to track the evolution of the vehicle fleet and the associated greenhouse gas emissions, criteria air pollutant emissions, and air quality, and health impacts of each scenario. We use the social cost of carbon and value of statistical life to estimate climate cumulative climate and health damages in each scenario. We assess health impacts across race, income, and geography. We use second-hand vehicle prices to estimate the cost of accelerated retirement policies and identify the most cost-effective policy options. We find that ZEV sales mandates will be insufficient to reach California’s climate targets, and that accelerated retirement policies targeting heavy-heavy duty vehicles will be most cost-effective. </p>

          <li> <a>Designing Efficient and Equitable Retail Rate for Distributed Energy Resources. [with Bruce Cain, In&#234s Azevedo]</a></li>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> Rooftop solar and storage (distributed electricity generation, DER) can play an important role in enabling decarbonization and improving reliability. Households can consume, store, or send the electricity produced by DER back to the grid. Under net-energy metering policies, households with DER are compensated for the surplus electricity produced at the retail electricity rate. Retail rates typically charge residential users a volumetric rate that covers the bulk of energy, transmission, and distribution costs. The resulting price, charged per unit of electricity, neither reflects the marginal costs of producing the electricity nor does it vary by space and time. Non time-varying volumetric electricity rates also don’t accurately reflect the true benefits that DERs provide to the electricity grid and has led to interest among policymakers to modernize the electricity rates. Significant concerns on cross-subsidies have also been raised. By realizing significant bill savings under net-energy metering, adopters of DERs effectively shift part of their obligation for the grid operation costs to non-adopters. Hence, challenge to modernize the electricity rate entails aligning prices to the true cost of generation of electricity; pricing benefits to the true benefits DERs provide; and ensuring that non-adopters, often low income and/or renters, don’t bear the burdens of cost-shift. In this work, we propose an electricity pricing and household electricity consumption model that tests different electricity rates to enable efficiency and equity for adopters and non-adopters. California, which has one of the highest electricity rates and penetration of DERs in the United States, is used as a case-study for demonstration.</p>

          <li> <a> What's happening to California's Electricity prices? A Primer [with Bruce Cain, In&#234s Azevedo]</a></li>

               <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

                <p> California has taken great strides in modernizing and decarbonizing its electricity system. The state has one of the least carbon intensive electricity and has the largest adoption of grid-scale storage (3,136 MW), residential rooftop (13,064 MW), and zero emissions vehicles (18% of total sales) in the country. Despite high economic growth, electricity consumption has remained constant due to improvements in energy efficiency, structural changes in economy, and the state’s moderate climate. These improvements are accompanied by challenges to the electricity grid operations and costs. The famous ‘duck-curve’ of California’s is now akin to a ‘canyon-curve’ as mid-day net load drops to zero due to high solar resources and ramps to morning and evening peaks challenging grid planners. Electricity is costly in California -- customers in the three investor-owned utilities area pay 45% -100% more than the national average per kilowatt hour. State’s core strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045 relies on electrifying end-uses such as transportation and heating which would be less favorable for consumer with high electricity prices. This primer is an attempt to parse out different reasons for increasing electricity rates. Few questions of interest were : what are the major drivers for increasing costs for utilities? How have total electricity sales within different subsectors changed? How will electrification of transportation and heating affect the network infrastructure and socio-economic inequities in the state? </p>
